1.1 Need Of New System
Services from a store that serves both walk-in customers and online customers. The
online shopping system presents an online display of an order cutoff time and an
associated delivery window for items selected by the customer. The system accepts
the customer's submission of a purchase order for the item in response to a time of
submission being before the order cutoff time. The online shopping system does not
settle with a credit supplier of the customer until the item selected by the customer
is picked from inventory but before it is delivered. Therefore, the customer can go
online and make changes to the order. In addition, available service windows are
presented to the customer as a function of customer selected order and service types;
and further, the order picking is assigned in accordance with a picker's preference.
